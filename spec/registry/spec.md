## Abstract

This document serves as an official registry for all known extensions to the [DID DHT Method specification](../index.html).

All are welcome to propose changes to this registry.

## Extensions

### Key Type Index

Corresponds to the mapping, for a DID Document's DNS packet representation, of a cryptograhpic key type to its index value.

| Index | Key Type                                               |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0     | [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/)                   |
| 1     | [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1)      |
| 2     | [secp256r1](https://neuromancer.sk/std/secg/secp256r1) |


An example [Verification Method]((https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#verification-methods)) record represented as a DNS TXT
record is as follows:

| Name      | Type | TTL  | Rdata                                                     |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| _k0._did. | TXT  | 7200 | id=abcd,t=0,k=r96mnGNgWGOmjt6g_3_0nd4Kls5-kknrd4DdPW8qtfw |

### Indexed Types

Represents an optional extension to a DID Document's DNS packet representation exposed as a [type index](../index.html#type-indexing).

::: note
The type `0` is reserved for DIDs that do not wish to associate themselves with a specific type, but wish to make
themselves discoverable via a [[ref:Gateway]]'s API.
:::

| Type Name               | Schema                                    | Type Integer |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------| ------------ |
| Discoverable            | -                                         | 0            |
| Organization            | https://schema.org/Organization           | 1            |
| Government Organization | https://schema.org/GovernmentOrganization | 2            |
| Corporation             | https://schema.org/Corporation            | 3            |
| Local Business          | https://schema.org/LocalBusiness          | 4            |
| Software Package        | https://schema.org/SoftwareSourceCode     | 5            |
| Web App                 | https://schema.org/WebApplication         | 6            |
| Financial Institution   | https://schema.org/FinancialService       | 7            |

### Gateways

As an **OPTIONAL** feature of the DID DHT Method, Gateway operators have the opportunity to make their [gateways](../index.html#gateways) discoverable. This serves as a registry for such gateways.

Gateways ****MUST**** specify the source of their `HASH` value, and the mechanism by which their gateway(s) can be discovered.

#### Bitcoin Anchored Gateways

Bitcoin is used as a gateway discovery mechanism. By crawling the Bitcoin blockchain, one can discover gateways that are considered to be active. To be considered an active gateway, you ****MUST**** follow the steps outlined below, in order to have an active timelock, which acts as a proof-of-legitimacy for the gateway.

1. Generate a relative [[ref:timelock]] transaction for the Bitcoin blockchain with the following attributes:
    - Set the lock duration to 1000
    - Add locked value locked must be no less than the mean value of the upper quintile of [UTXOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output) as of a block that is no more than 10 blocks earlier from the block the locking transaction is included in (this effectively provides a 10 block grace period for the transaction to make it into the chain).
    - Add an `OP_RETURN` string composed of the following comma-separated values:
        - The block number used to compute the mean value of the upper quintile of [UTXOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output).
        - The `URI` where your node can be addressed
2. Include the [[ref:timelock]] transaction within 10 blocks of the block number specified for the average UTXO value calculation.
3. If this is a relocking transaction that refreshes an existing registration of a node:
    - The relocking transaction ****MUST**** spend the outputs of the lock it replaces.
    - If the operator wants to prevent other nodes and clients using the decentralized registry from dropping the Registered Gateway from their Registered Gateway list, the relocking transaction ****MUST**** be included in the blockchain within ten blocks of the previous lock's expiration.

##### Hash

The hash source to be used is [Bitcoin block hashes](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/block_header#:~:text=Definitions%3A,cryptographic%20nonce%20(if%20needed).). It is ****RECOMMENDED**** to use the most recent block hash value.

##### Discovery

To discover Bitcoin Anchored Gateways one must follow the following steps:

1. Starting at block height of `817714` traverse the chain, checking the value of the `OP_RETURN` field of transactions with _at least_ **6 confirmations**.
2. Find transactions that match the form `block number + uri`, as per the [steps outlined in the section above](#bitcoin-anchored-gateways).
